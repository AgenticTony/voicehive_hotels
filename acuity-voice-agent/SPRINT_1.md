# Sprint 1: Foundation & Architecture

## Sprint Overview

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Set up the project foundation and establish the core architecture for the SaaS platform.

## Objectives

1. Establish the technical foundation and architecture
2. Set up development environments and tools
3. Define data models and database structure
4. Implement core authentication system
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Tasks

### Development Environment Setup

- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting rules (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS and UI component library
- [ ] Set up testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Create Docker development environment

### Database & Data Models

- [ ] Set up MongoDB connection
- [ ] Define and implement User model
- [ ] Define and implement Client model for Acuity OAuth tokens
- [ ] Define and implement BusinessProfile model
- [ ] Design database schema for subscriptions and voice agents
- [ ] Create database migration strategy

### Authentication System

- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Set up OAuth providers (Google, email magic link)
- [ ] Create authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Create authentication API endpoints

### API Foundation

- [ ] Define API structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Implement middleware for API authentication
- [ ] Set up error handling and logging for API endpoints
- [ ] Create basic health check and status endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### CI/CD Setup

- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Set up automated testing workflow
- [ ] Configure staging and production environments
- [ ] Implement deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create infrastructure-as-code templates for cloud services

## Dependencies

- Node.js and npm/yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account
- GitHub repository
- Development tools and IDEs

## Deliverables

1. Project repository with initial codebase
2. Working development environment with Docker configuration
3. Database models and connection setup
4. Authentication system with at least one working provider
5. CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Success Criteria

- Developers can run the application locally
- Authentication system allows user registration and login
- Database models are defined and tested
- CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and runs tests
- Project architecture document is complete

## Risks

- Authentication complexity might require more time than allocated
- Database design might need future revisions based on evolving requirements
- Environment setup might vary between team members

## Knowledge Sharing

- Schedule a session to review the project architecture
- Document the development workflow and standards
- Create a guide for setting up the local development environment
