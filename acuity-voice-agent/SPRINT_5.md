# Sprint 5: Retell Integration

## Sprint Overview

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Implement integration with Retell API for voice agent creation and management

## Objectives

1. Research and document Retell API capabilities
2. Create Retell API client module
3. Implement voice agent creation flow
4. Build voice agent configuration management
5. Develop testing infrastructure for voice agents

## Tasks

### Retell API Research

- [ ] Analyze Retell API documentation
- [ ] Identify available voices and capabilities
- [ ] Document API limitations and constraints
- [ ] Explore available customization options
- [ ] Create example API requests and responses

### Retell API Client

- [ ] Create authentication module for Retell API
- [ ] Implement API request/response handling
- [ ] Develop error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Create rate limiting handling
- [ ] Build logging for API interactions

### Voice Agent Creation

- [ ] Implement endpoint for creating new voice agents
- [ ] Develop voice selection logic
- [ ] Create agent naming and identification system
- [ ] Build agent initialization process
- [ ] Implement callback URL configuration

### Agent Configuration Management

- [ ] Create database schema for agent configurations
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for agent settings
- [ ] Develop prompt template system
- [ ] Create function call configuration
- [ ] Build configuration versioning system

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Create agent simulation environment
- [ ] Implement test call functionality
- [ ] Build mock customer interactions
- [ ] Develop testing dashboard for agents
- [ ] Create reporting for test results

## Dependencies

- Business profile system from Sprint 3
- Acuity integration from Sprint 3
- Retell API access and documentation

## Deliverables

1. Retell API client module
2. Voice agent creation and configuration API
3. Agent template and customization system
4. Agent testing infrastructure
5. Documentation for voice agent capabilities

## Success Criteria

- Voice agents can be created through the API
- Agent configurations can be managed and updated
- Different voices can be selected for agents
- Agents can be tested in a simulated environment
- System handles Retell API errors gracefully

## Risks

- Retell API might have undocumented limitations
- Voice agent capabilities might not match all requirements
- API rate limits could affect scalability
- Testing voice agents might be technically challenging

## Knowledge Sharing

- Document Retell API capabilities and limitations
- Create guide for voice agent configuration
- Share testing strategies for voice agents
