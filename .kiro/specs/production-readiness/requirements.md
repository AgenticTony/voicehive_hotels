# Production Readiness & Security Hardening - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical production readiness gaps identified in the VoiceHive Hotels codebase analysis. The current system has excellent architecture but lacks essential production features including authentication, rate limiting, comprehensive error handling, and security hardening measures that are required before any production deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication & Authorization System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive authentication and authorization system so that all API endpoints are properly secured and access is controlled based on user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to any protected endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response with proper error details
2. WHEN a valid JWT token is provided THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and allow access to authorized resources
3. WHEN service-to-service communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use API keys or mutual TLS for authentication
4. WHEN an authenticated user accesses a resource they don't have permission for THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
5. WHEN JWT tokens expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication and provide clear error messages
6. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL validate them against a secure store and track usage

### Requirement 2: Rate Limiting & Circuit Breakers

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive rate limiting and circuit breaker protection so that the system remains stable under high load and protects against abuse and cascading failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed defined rate limits THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after headers
2. WHEN external service calls fail repeatedly THEN circuit breakers SHALL open and prevent further calls for a defined period
3. WHEN circuit breakers are open THEN the system SHALL return appropriate fallback responses or cached data
4. WHEN rate limits are applied THEN they SHALL be configurable per client, endpoint, and time window
5. WHEN backpressure occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle load and prevent resource exhaustion
6. WHEN circuit breakers recover THEN they SHALL gradually allow traffic through (half-open state)

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer and operator, I want standardized error handling across all services so that errors are properly logged, monitored, and communicated to clients in a consistent format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with appropriate severity level and correlation ID
2. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN errors are returned to clients THEN they SHALL follow a standardized format with error codes and messages
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate alerts and notifications
5. WHEN errors happen in async operations THEN they SHALL be properly propagated and not silently fail
6. WHEN PMS connector calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and fallback responses

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want optimized performance characteristics so that the system can handle production load efficiently with minimal resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling with configurable limits
2. WHEN Redis connections are established THEN they SHALL be pooled and reused across requests
3. WHEN HTTP clients make external calls THEN connections SHALL be reused and properly managed
4. WHEN audio streaming occurs THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to prevent leaks and excessive consumption
5. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL have configurable TTL and eviction policies
6. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include response times, throughput, and resource usage

### Requirement 5: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive security controls implemented so that the system meets enterprise security standards and protects against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is received THEN it SHALL be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
2. WHEN webhooks are received THEN their signatures SHALL be verified for authenticity
3. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged to an immutable audit trail
4. WHEN HTTP responses are sent THEN they SHALL include appropriate security headers
5. WHEN PII data is processed THEN it SHALL be automatically redacted from logs and non-essential storage
6. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL require proper authorization and be audited

### Requirement 6: Monitoring & Observability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability so that I can detect issues early, understand system behavior, and maintain high availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business operations occur THEN relevant metrics SHALL be collected and exposed
2. WHEN system health changes THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be triggered with actionable information
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL provide sufficient data to identify root causes
4. WHEN SLA violations occur THEN they SHALL be automatically detected and reported
5. WHEN distributed traces are collected THEN they SHALL provide end-to-end visibility across services
6. WHEN dashboards are created THEN they SHALL show key business and technical metrics

### Requirement 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive testing coverage so that we can deploy changes confidently and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL cover all critical user journeys end-to-end
2. WHEN load tests execute THEN they SHALL validate system performance under expected traffic patterns
3. WHEN chaos engineering tests run THEN they SHALL verify system resilience under failure conditions
4. WHEN security tests execute THEN they SHALL validate all authentication and authorization flows
5. WHEN API tests run THEN they SHALL verify all endpoints respond correctly to valid and invalid inputs
6. WHEN deployment tests execute THEN they SHALL verify successful deployment and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8: Documentation & Operations

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want complete operational documentation so that I can deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL be complete, accurate, and include examples
2. WHEN deployment procedures are followed THEN they SHALL be documented with step-by-step instructions
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN comprehensive guides SHALL be available for common problems
4. WHEN security incidents occur THEN documented response procedures SHALL be available
5. WHEN system architecture is reviewed THEN current diagrams and documentation SHALL be available
6. WHEN onboarding new team members THEN complete setup and development guides SHALL be provided
