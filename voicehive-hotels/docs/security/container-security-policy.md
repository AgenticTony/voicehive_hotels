# Container Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the container security standards and practices for VoiceHive Hotels. All container images must comply with these security requirements before deployment to production environments.

## Security Requirements

### 1. Base Image Security

#### Distroless Images

- **Requirement**: All production containers MUST use Google Distroless base images
- **Rationale**: Minimal attack surface, no shell, no package managers
- **Approved Base Images**:
  - `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot` - For Python services
  - `gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian12:nonroot` - For Java services (if needed)
  - `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs18-debian12:nonroot` - For Node.js services (if needed)

#### Base Image Validation

- Base images MUST be scanned for vulnerabilities before use
- Critical and High severity vulnerabilities MUST be addressed
- Base image versions MUST be pinned with specific digests
- Base images MUST be updated monthly or when security patches are available

### 2. Multi-Stage Build Requirements

#### Build Stage Security

- Build dependencies MUST be installed in separate build stage
- Build stage MUST use minimal package installation
- Unnecessary build tools MUST NOT be present in final image
- Build cache MUST be cleared after package installation

#### Security Scanning Integration

- Each build MUST include vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Security scans MUST fail the build on Critical/High vulnerabilities
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) MUST be generated for each image
- Container configuration MUST be scanned for misconfigurations

### 3. Runtime Security

#### User and Permissions

- Containers MUST run as non-root user (nonroot:nonroot)
- Root filesystem MUST be read-only
- Containers MUST drop ALL capabilities
- Privilege escalation MUST be disabled

#### Network Security

- Only required ports MUST be exposed
- Network policies MUST restrict inter-pod communication
- TLS MUST be used for all external communications
- Service mesh SHOULD be used for internal service communication

#### Resource Constraints

- CPU and memory limits MUST be defined
- Temporary filesystem usage MUST be limited
- Process limits MUST be enforced
- File descriptor limits MUST be set

### 4. Supply Chain Security

#### Image Signing

- All production images MUST be signed with Cosign
- Signatures MUST be verified before deployment
- Keyless signing with OIDC MUST be used
- Signature verification MUST be enforced in admission controllers

#### SBOM Requirements

- SPDX-format SBOM MUST be generated for each image
- SBOM MUST be attested and stored with image
- SBOM MUST include all dependencies and their versions
- SBOM MUST be accessible for compliance audits

#### Provenance Tracking

- Build provenance MUST be generated and attested
- Source code repository MUST be traceable
- Build environment MUST be reproducible
- CI/CD pipeline integrity MUST be verified

### 5. Vulnerability Management

#### Scanning Requirements

- Images MUST be scanned before deployment
- Daily vulnerability scans MUST be performed on production images
- New vulnerabilities MUST trigger automated alerts
- Critical vulnerabilities MUST be patched within 24 hours

#### Vulnerability Response

- Critical vulnerabilities require immediate response
- High vulnerabilities must be addressed within 7 days
- Medium vulnerabilities must be addressed within 30 days
- Low vulnerabilities should be addressed in next maintenance window

### 6. Compliance and Monitoring

#### Runtime Monitoring

- Falco rules MUST monitor container behavior
- Anomalous behavior MUST trigger alerts
- Security events MUST be logged and audited
- Compliance violations MUST be reported

#### Audit Requirements

- Container security posture MUST be audited monthly
- Compliance reports MUST be generated automatically
- Security metrics MUST be tracked and reported
- Incident response procedures MUST be documented

## Implementation Guidelines

### Dockerfile Standards

```dockerfile
# ✅ GOOD: Security-hardened Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Build stage with minimal dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot
# Distroless runtime with security labels
LABEL security.distroless="true"
LABEL security.scan="trivy"
USER nonroot:nonroot
```

```dockerfile
# ❌ BAD: Insecure Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
# Full OS with unnecessary packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl wget
# Running as root user
USER root
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### Required Pipeline Steps

1. **Build Stage**

   - Multi-stage build with security scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - SBOM generation

2. **Security Stage**

   - Container vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Grype)
   - Configuration scanning
   - Compliance checking

3. **Attestation Stage**

   - Image signing with Cosign
   - SBOM attestation
   - Provenance generation

4. **Deployment Stage**
   - Signature verification
   - Policy enforcement
   - Runtime security configuration

### Kubernetes Security Configuration

#### Pod Security Standards

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 65534
    runAsGroup: 65534
    fsGroup: 65534
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
    - name: app
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        capabilities:
          drop:
            - ALL
```

#### Network Policies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: voicehive-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: voicehive
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: voicehive
  egress:
    - to: []
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443
```

## Monitoring and Alerting
