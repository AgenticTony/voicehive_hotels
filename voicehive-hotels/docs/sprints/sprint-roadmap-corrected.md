# VoiceHive Hotels Sprint Roadmap - CORRECTED
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12
**Total Duration**: 36 days (7.2 weeks)
**Objective**: Complete, production-ready, Fortune 500-grade AI receptionist platform

## Executive Summary

This corrected roadmap reflects **accurate implementation status** based on comprehensive code analysis. Previous sprint documentation contained significant inaccuracies - this roadmap provides realistic timelines and dependencies for achieving true 100% completion.

**Key Corrections**:
- Authentication and rate limiting are **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (contrary to previous claims)
- Several items marked "complete" still have missing implementations
- Intent detection is **MISSING** and blocks all call functionality
- Realistic timelines based on actual complexity analysis
