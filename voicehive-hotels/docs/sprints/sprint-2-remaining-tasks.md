# Sprint 2: Remaining Production Readiness Tasks

**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Sprint Status**: 87% Complete (B+ Grade)  
**Remaining Work**: Critical production hardening tasks

## Executive Summary

Sprint 2 has delivered solid enterprise-grade implementations with comprehensive security, monitoring, and testing frameworks. However, several critical items need completion before production deployment, as identified during senior developer review against industry best practices.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Tasks (Must Complete Before Production)

### 1. Replace File Path Validation with Functional Testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Effort**: 2 days

- [ ] Implement health check endpoints for all external services
- [ ] Add runtime validation of JWT token generation/validation
- [ ] Test actual database connectivity and query execution
- [ ] Validate Redis operations (get/set/expire)
- [ ] Test Vault secret retrieval operations

**Reference**: Per [HashiCorp Vault Best Practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies), health checks should validate actual operations, not just connectivity.

### 2. Complete Vault Integration for Production
