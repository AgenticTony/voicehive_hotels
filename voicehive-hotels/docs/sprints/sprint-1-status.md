   - Set up LiveKit Cloud account
   - Request GPU node quota increase
   - Create service directories

2. **Afternoon**:
   - Configure SIP trunk
   - Begin Riva container setup
   - Update architecture diagrams

## Notes 📝

- Remember to follow EU data residency requirements
- All API keys must be stored in Vault
- Use existing PMS connector factory from Sprint 0
- Maintain backward compatibility with orchestrator API
- **Infrastructure Note**: Enhanced terraform files for GPU support need to be created as part of Day 2-3 work. The current terraform infrastructure from Sprint 0 only includes basic EKS setup without GPU node support
