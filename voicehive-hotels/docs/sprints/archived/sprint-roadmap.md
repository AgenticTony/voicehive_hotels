# VoiceHive Hotels Sprint Roadmap
**Duration**: 4 Weeks  
**Objective**: Production-ready multilingual AI receptionist with 5 PMS integrations

## Executive Summary

We're building a partner-ready system where 80% of integration code is reusable. This approach enables us to:
- Add new PMS integrations in 3-5 days vs 3-4 weeks
- Maintain consistent behavior across all hotel systems
- Pass security audits with pre-built compliance
- Scale to 100+ concurrent calls with <500ms latency
