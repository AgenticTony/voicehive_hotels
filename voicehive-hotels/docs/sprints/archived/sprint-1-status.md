## Notes 📝

### Production Readiness Context

- **CRITICAL**: Production deployment is currently BLOCKED by missing authentication, incomplete implementations, and lack of rate limiting
- **Timeline**: Estimated 4-6 weeks to achieve full production readiness
- **Strategy**: Phased deployment recommended (staging → limited pilot → full production)
- **Risk**: Current code has security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before any production exposure

### Development Guidelines

- Remember to follow EU data residency requirements
- All API keys must be stored in Vault
- Use existing PMS connector factory from Sprint 0
- Maintain backward compatibility with orchestrator API
- **Infrastructure Note**: Enhanced terraform files for GPU support need to be created as part of Day 2-3 work. The current terraform infrastructure from Sprint 0 only includes basic EKS setup without GPU node support

### Code Quality Standards

- All TODO comments must be resolved before production
- Implement proper error handling for all external API calls
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging and audit purposes
- Ensure all endpoints have proper authentication and rate limiting
- Follow security best practices for all user inputs and data processing

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests must achieve 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests required for all critical paths
- Load testing must validate performance under expected traffic
- Security testing must validate all authentication and authorization flows
