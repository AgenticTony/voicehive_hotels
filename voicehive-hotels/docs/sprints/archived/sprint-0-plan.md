# Sprint 0: Foundation & Partner SDK
**Duration**: Week 1 (5 days)
**Goal**: Production infrastructure + PMS connector framework with Apaleo quick win

## Sprint Objectives
1. Establish production-grade cloud infrastructure with EU compliance
2. Build reusable PMS connector SDK (80% of integration work)
3. Implement and certify first connector (Apaleo) as proof of concept
4. Set up security, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines

## User Stories

### 1. Infrastructure Foundation (Day 1-2)
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** production-ready cloud infrastructure  
**So that** we can deploy services with 99.95% availability

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create AWS Organization with separate accounts (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Configure EU regions only (eu-west-1, eu-central-1)
- [ ] Deploy EKS clusters with GPU node pools
- [ ] Set up VPC with private subnets for data compliance
- [ ] Configure HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Set up Terraform state management with S3 + DynamoDB
- [ ] Configure AWS KMS for encryption keys

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ All resources deployed in EU regions only
- ✓ Zero secrets in code - all in Vault
- ✓ GPU nodes available for Riva deployment
- ✓ Network isolation for PII data

### 2. PMS Connector SDK (Day 2-3)
**As a** partner integration engineer  
**I want** a universal PMS connector framework  
**So that** adding new PMS takes days, not weeks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `PMSConnector` protocol interface
- [ ] Create base connector with retry/circuit breaker logic  
- [ ] Build capability matrix configuration system
- [ ] Develop golden contract test suite
- [ ] Create connector factory for dynamic selection
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/API key broker service
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling hierarchy

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ All connectors implement same interface
- ✓ Golden tests validate consistent behavior
- ✓ Capability matrix controls feature flags
- ✓ 100% type coverage with mypy strict

### 3. Apaleo Connector Implementation (Day 3-4)
**As a** hotel using Apaleo  
**I want** VoiceHive to integrate with my PMS  
**So that** AI can access reservations and guest data

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Register for Apaleo developer account
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
- [ ] Build all required methods (availability, rates, reservations)
- [ ] Handle Apaleo-specific field mappings
- [ ] Add retry logic for rate limits
- [ ] Create integration tests with sandbox
- [ ] Document any Apaleo limitations/workarounds

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Pass 100% of golden contract tests
- ✓ Handle all Apaleo API errors gracefully
- ✓ Complete reservation lifecycle (create/modify/cancel)
- ✓ Performance: <200ms response time (cached)

### 4. Security & Compliance Framework (Day 4)
**As a** security officer  
**I want** GDPR-compliant data handling  
**So that** we can pass hotel security audits

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement EU region validation service
- [ ] Create PII detection/redaction service
- [ ] Build consent management API
- [ ] Set up audit logging with immutability
- [ ] Configure data retention policies
- [ ] Create DSAR (data subject access request) tools
- [ ] Generate security documentation templates

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ No PII in logs (automated scanning)
- ✓ All data stays in EU (monitoring alerts)
- ✓ Consent tracked with timestamps
- ✓ Data deletion within 30 days

### 5. CI/CD & Monitoring (Day 5)
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** automated testing and deployment  
**So that** we can ship safely and quickly

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Configure security scanning (Snyk, Trivy)
- [ ] Implement automated connector testing
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus + Grafana stack
- [ ] Create PMS integration dashboards
- [ ] Set up PagerDuty alerts
- [ ] Configure structured logging with Loki

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ No merge without passing golden tests
- ✓ Security scans on every PR
- ✓ Deployment time < 10 minutes
- ✓ All metrics visible in dashboards

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Apaleo API changes | High | Use API versioning, monitor changelog |
| GPU node availability | Medium | Reserve instances, have CPU fallback |
| Vault setup complexity | Medium | Use managed solution if needed |
| Golden test coverage | Low | Start with core features, expand later |

## Dependencies
- Apaleo developer account approval (Day 1)
- AWS account with GPU quotas
- Domain names for services
- SSL certificates

## Definition of Done
