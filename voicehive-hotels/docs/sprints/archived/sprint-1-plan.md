**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics for call flow
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for voice pipeline
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Add call recording with PII redaction
- [ ] Create quality scoring metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting rules

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Real-time visibility into call metrics
- P95 latencies tracked per component
- Call recordings available for review

### 8. Integration Testing (Day 5)
**Story**: As a developer, I need confidence the system works end-to-end

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create call simulation harness
- [ ] Add multilingual test scenarios
- [ ] Test error paths and fallbacks
- [ ] Load test with 10 concurrent calls
- [ ] Validate GDPR compliance
- [ ] Document call flows

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All test scenarios pass
- System handles 10 concurrent calls
- Meets latency SLOs

## üìä Sprint Metrics

### Technical Goals
- **P95 Round-trip latency**: ‚â§ 500ms
- **ASR TTFB**: ‚â§ 250ms  
- **TTS TTFB**: ‚â§ 250ms
- **Barge-in response**: ‚â§ 100ms
- **Concurrent calls**: 10+

### Quality Targets
- **Word Error Rate**: < 15% for supported languages
- **Intent Accuracy**: > 90% for common queries
- **Call Completion Rate**: > 85%
- **Mean Opinion Score**: > 4.0

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

1. **LiveKit Cloud** vs self-hosted: Cloud for reliability, EU region for compliance
2. **NVIDIA Riva** for ASR: Best multilingual accuracy with on-prem control  
3. **Azure OpenAI** for NLU: Function calling + low latency
4. **ElevenLabs** for TTS: Most natural voices, with Azure fallback
5. **Redis** for state: Fast call context storage
6. **gRPC** for Riva: Native protocol with streaming support

## üöß Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| GPU availability | High | Reserve instances, have CPU fallback |
| LiveKit latency | Medium | Use closest EU region, optimize codec |
| Model cold start | Medium | Keep models warm, use smaller variants |
| Language detection errors | Low | Implement confidence thresholds |

## üì¶ Deliverables

1. **Working voice pipeline** handling real calls
2. **Multilingual support** for 5+ languages
3. **PMS integration** via connector SDK
4. **Call quality dashboard** in Grafana
5. **Integration test suite** with recordings
6. **Deployment runbook** for production

## üéØ Definition of Done

- [ ] Successful multilingual call with PMS lookup
- [ ] All components deployed to Kubernetes  
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Sprint review demo prepared
