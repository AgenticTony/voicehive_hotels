- **Evidence Collection**: Automated audit evidence script

### 4. CI/CD & Monitoring ✅
- **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: 
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Security scanning (Trivy, Semgrep)
  - Infrastructure validation
  - Blue-green deployment support
- **Monitoring Stack**:
  - Prometheus with service discovery
  - Grafana dashboards for PMS connectors
  - Alert rules for SLA violations
  - Health check endpoints across all services
- **Metrics Integration**: 
  - Orchestrator exposes Prometheus metrics
  - Component health monitoring

### 5. Documentation & Developer Experience ✅

- **Connector Documentation**: How to add new PMS integrations
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs for all services
- **Quick Reference Guide**: Sprint accomplishments and key information
- **Partner Security Handout**: For vendor onboarding

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

1. **Protocol-Based Design**: Using Python protocols instead of ABCs for better type safety and flexibility
2. **80/20 Architecture**: Base connector handles 80% common logic, adapters handle 20% vendor-specific
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: YAML-based capability matrix allows runtime behavior changes
4. **EU-First Infrastructure**: All resources in EU regions with data residency enforcement
5. **Security by Default**: Non-root containers, encrypted everything, minimal permissions
