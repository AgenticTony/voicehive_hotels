# Archived Sprint Documentation

**Archived Date**: 2025-10-12
**Reason**: Inaccurate status claims and outdated information

## What's Archived Here

This directory contains the original sprint documentation that was found to contain significant inaccuracies during comprehensive code analysis:

### Issues with Original Documentation
- **Sprint 0 Status**: Claimed 100% completion when actually ~85% complete
- **Sprint 1 Status**: Incorrectly claimed missing authentication/rate limiting (these actually exist and are well-implemented)
- **Multiple TODO items**: Marked as complete but still had missing implementations
- **Unrealistic timelines**: Not based on actual code complexity

### Files Archived
- `sprint-roadmap.md` - Original roadmap with inaccurate timelines
- `sprint-0-*.md` - Sprint 0 documentation with completion overclaims
- `sprint-1-*.md` - Sprint 1 documentation with incorrect missing feature claims

## Current Sprint Documentation

The corrected and accurate sprint documentation is now located in the parent directory:

- `sprint-0-corrected.md` - Accurate status of completed foundation work
- `sprint-1-corrected.md` - Critical missing implementations (5 days)
- `sprint-2-production-readiness.md` - Production validation system (7 days)
- `sprint-3-advanced-features.md` - PMS expansion and advanced features (10 days)
- `sprint-4-optimization-scaling.md` - Architecture optimization (14 days)
- `sprint-roadmap-corrected.md` - Realistic 36-day timeline to completion

## Key Corrections Made

### Major Discovery
- **Authentication & Rate Limiting**: These are ALREADY IMPLEMENTED with 318 LOC auth middleware and 366 LOC rate limiter
- **Intent Detection**: This is MISSING and blocks all call functionality - made priority #1

### Realistic Assessment
- **Sprint 0**: 85% complete (not 100%)
- **Remaining Work**: 36 days across 4 sprints to achieve true 100% completion
- **Timelines**: Based on actual code complexity analysis
