## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Scan all services for vulnerabilities
make security-scan-deps

# Update dependencies with security patches
make security-update

# Check license compliance
make license-check

# Generate comprehensive security dashboard
make security-full

# Pin dependencies with hash verification
make security-pin-deps

# Run security audit (fails on critical vulnerabilities)
make security-audit
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
# Initialize security manager
manager = DependencySecurityManager(project_root)

# Scan for vulnerabilities
reports = await manager.scan_vulnerabilities("all")

# Apply security updates
results = await manager.update_dependencies("all", security_only=True)

# Pin dependencies with hashes
success = await manager.pin_dependencies_with_hashes("all")
```
